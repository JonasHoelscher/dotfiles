# Dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles configuration.
Install this using
```bash
git clone  --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JonasHoelscher/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The installation script checks the computers hostname and creates symlinks for the specific configs.
The configs from the folder 'common' are always installed.
